The dataset consists of customer information collected from a Mall.

The task is to find patterns in this data to create a variable class.

Attributes:
1.Customer_ID
2.Genre
3.Age
4.Annual Income
5.Spending Score (Indicator of how much a customer spends)

The 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score' attributes are to be selected as key indicators.
The values of this class will be the segments of customers.

The model has to find the optimal number of segments, train and then predict the class.

Segmenting customers in different categories allows to make useful business decisions.
