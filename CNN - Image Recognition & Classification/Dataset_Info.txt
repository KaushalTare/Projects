GTRSB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is a multi-class, 
single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. 
It consists of about 50,000 images in total which are classified into 43 categories,
with unbalanced distribution between the categories.

The challenge is to make an image recognition and classification model,
 that would identify the traffic signs with high accuracy.
